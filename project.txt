Project for the exam of Computer Science for HEP, modules 4 and 5
=================================================================

Create a virtual machine on Google Cloud with the following characteristics:
- 2 CPUs, 4 GB memory
- CentOS Stream 8 operating system
- 30 GB disk
- under Advanced Options -> Security -> Access Management, add the following SSH key


ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIO3dlLZU37NgQofgLnxoQAYS/EnC8XS7BCd5oYGNpIwW chierici@infn.it

On this VM install Docker and enable the service. Create the directory
$HOME/containers/IMAP22, that will be the permanent storage for the next steps.

Create a Docker image starting from Ubuntu 22.04, that includes all the tools
and libraries (g++, cmake, SFML, TBB, ...) needed to develop, build and test the
parallel application described below. Inside the container, the storage
directory $HOME/containers/IMAP22 should be mounted on /workspace.

The parallel application consists in the computation of the Mandelbrot set,
starting from the sequential version available at
https://github.com/giacomini/cshep2022, under `project`. The focus of the
parallelization is the bi-dimensional iteration on the image pixels
corresponding to the complex plane around the origin, to be transformed into a
TBB parallel_for loop over a blocked_range2d. The parallel_for should use a
simple_partitioner and try multiple values of the grain size.

The output of the application includes:
- an image in PNG format of the Mandelbrot set
- a text file with two columns: the grain size and the execution time obtained
  with that grain size

Once the application is considered complete, build it in "Release mode" and be
sure to store everything under the /workspace directory. Then create another
Docker image starting from Ubuntu 22.04, that contains only what is needed to
run the application (e.g. there is no need for the compiler and cmake). Run the
image, mounting again $HOME/containers/IMAP22 in /workspace in the container;
run the application, producing the requested output.

Double check on the CentOS Stream 8 vitual machine that the requested 
output is saved in $HOME/containers/IMAP22.

Leave the virtual machine (with CentOS Stream 8) running and write an e-mail to
andrea.chierici7@unibo.it and francesco.giacomini3@unibo.it with the following
information:
- public IP address of the virtual machine
- the username for the login

You'll be notified once we have evaluated your work, so that you can 
switch the virtual machine off.
